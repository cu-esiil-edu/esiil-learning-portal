Located about 14 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, it offers flights to more than 200 destinations and handles over 83 million passengers annually.

([[]])\n\n\n\nIf you use single brackets, you will find that you get back something called a Series rather than a DataFrame, which will make things difficult down the road. A Series is a single column of a DataFrame. It still has an index (in this case our dates), but can’t do all the things a DataFrame can do. It also displays as plain text instead of a formatted table, so you can easily tell the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Select only the TMAX column of the O'Hare data\ntmax_df = df[['column_name']]\ntmax_df.describe()\n\n\n# Select only the TMAX column of the Northerly data\ntmax_df = df[['column_name']]\ntmax_df.describe()\n\n\n\nSee our solution!\nohare_tmax_df = ohare_df[['TMAX']]\nnortherly_tmax_df = northerly_df[['TMAX']]\nohare_tmax_df.describe(), northerly_tmax_df.describe()\n\n\n\n\nJoin data\nRight now, we have data from two stations in two separate DataFrames. We could work with that, but to make things go smoother (and learn how to work with DataFrames) we can join them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s a join?\n\n\n\nThere are a few different ways to combine DataFrames in Python. A join combines two DataFrames by their index (the dates in our case), checking to make sure that every date matches. In our case, we could concatenate instead without checking the dates, because all the dates are the same for our two DataFrames. That would probably be faster! But also, we think it is more error-prone. For example, it might not tell you that something was wrong if you accidentally downloaded data from two different years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry It: Join two `DataFrame`s\n\n\n\nStarting with the sample code below:\n\nReplace left_df with the name of the first DataFrame. In this case, it doesn’t matter which one you choose to be on the left, but you need to make sure that it matches the left suffix label (lsuffix).\nReplace right_df with the name of the second DataFrame, making sure it matches rsuffix.\nRun the code and check that your join happened correctly.\n\n\n\n\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    left_df\n    .join(\n        right_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()\n\n\n\nSee our solution!\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    ohare_tmax_df\n    .join(\n        northerly_tmax_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()"

Most things about hte plot we can change by passing parameters to the .plot() method (see below). However, we think the easiest way to change the legend labels in Python is to rename the columns.
