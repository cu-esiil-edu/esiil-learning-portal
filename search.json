This activity can support a variety of domain-specific topics in biology, physics, math, environmental science, and public health — all while teaching fundamental computational skills. As part of the activity, we will use data from the National Centers for Environmental Information, will discuss the critical link between FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible) data and cultural and/or personal relevance. By the end of the session, you will have the skills and resources you need to facilitate a computational climate change activity as an element in your next class."

As STEM educators we aren’t usually trained to productively channel student’s emotions and experiences. In this session we will cover three frameworks that we use at the Earth Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab to foster innovative, cross-cultural science teamwork: active listening, ethical space, and the “groan zone”. Active listening is an important skill for constructing a classroom environment where team members can express potentially traumatic or upsetting experiences that motivate their learning and inquiry goals. Ethical space is a framework for collaborating across cultures while respecting all team-members’ contributions and sovereignty. Finally, the “groan zone” refers to the fact that learning and innovating is inherently uncomfortable, and teams who can’t tolerate that discomfort miss out on the juicy and impactful ideas and understanding that lies on the other side. In this workshop, we will present these three frameworks, practice them using role play, and discuss some ways they can be used to facilitate cross-cultural student projects."

Indeed, we’ve observed that many departments would not hire their own undergraduates to do research because they lack coding skills. It is urgent to inject these skills into all kinds of science and math classrooms so that students feel confident applying for jobs and graduate programs in their field. In this workshop we will explore strategies that non-expert programmers can use to expose students to coding. We will discuss teaching coding using AI, teaching debugging skills rather than computer science concepts, and setting up an environment where students can support each other."
