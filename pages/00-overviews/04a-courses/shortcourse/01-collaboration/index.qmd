[Open reproducible
science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/get-started-open-reproducible-science/) makes scientific methods, data and outcomes available to everyone. That means that *everyone* who wants should be able to **find**, **read**, **understand**, and **run** your workflows for themselves.

Few if any science projects are 100% open and reproducible (yet!).
However, members of the open science community have developed open
source tools and practices that can help you move toward that goal. You will learn about many of those tools in [the Intro to Earth Data Science textbook](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/). Don’t worry about learning all the tools at once – we’ve picked a few
for you to get started with.
