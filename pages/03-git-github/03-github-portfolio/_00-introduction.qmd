# Get started with open, reproducible science

The internet has revolutionized science publishing. For example, most published scientific papers are now made freely available online within one year [@randall_munroe_rise_2013]:

[![The Rise of Open Science: The accelerating pace of scientific publishing and the rise of open access, as depicted by xkcd.com cartoonist Randall Munroe. Open access reached a tipping point in 2011, when more than half of new research became available freely online.](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/4/48/the_rise_of_open_access.jpg)](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.342.6154.58)

It's not just peer-reviewed publications that have changed -- scientists all over the world now use websites, blogs, and social media to discuss, communicate, and publicize their work. The internet is also a great way to transparently involve your community in your research.

Not all science has to be open! It's important to think about the impacts of publishing your work on people and communities wherever you are studying, and also honor principles data sovereignty. We will talk about some ways to publish your work while omitting or obscuring sensitive details, but for now make sure that you and your mentors are comfortable before putting your work on the internet.

There are lots of tools available for creating free websites. We, as Earth and Environmental Data Scientists, like to use a platform called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a couple of reasons:

  1. It's **completely free** to use, event for larger websites (like this one!).
  2. It is a feature of the code collaboration website [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is **already where most programmers and scientists keep their code**. Keeping our websites on GitHub also means that we can **collaborate on and discuss** them online, the same way we would any other code.
  3. It can automatically build an attractive website using text-based, human-readable tools.
  4. It can automatically incorporate the plots and maps generated by code.
  5. Though GitHub itself is not open source software (it's owned by Microsoft), Pages is built on open-source tools. This means that if for some reason the availability or pricing structure ever changes we could download the code and put the website up somewhere else.

In the following lesson, you will learn how to create a personal portfolio webpage and publish it for free using GitHub Pages.
