title: Build your Environmental Data Science portfolio
subtitle: Tell us about yourself and get started with open, reproducible science
description: |
  Your first project for Stars is also your first step towards becoming an Environmental Data Scientist -- building a **portfolio website** so you can share your work!
learning-goals:
  - Experiment with some key aspects of coding: syntax and parameters
  - Build a portfolio website to share your work
  - Get to know each other
  - Explain how web publishing is important for open science
  - Describe the web publishing tool GitHub Pages
  - Name some advantages of GitHub Pages for web publishing

# Welcome to your first ESIIL Stars Coding Challenge!

When we meet for our in-person Environmental Data Science training, we'd like for all of us to be able to share our websites with each other. You don't have to have any data science projects on it yet! But, there are a couple of reasons we are assigning this challenge:

  1. It's a great way to get to know each other! We hope you will show off your creativity and share about yourselves and your community on your website.
  2. Portfolio websites are incredibly valuable when you are looking for jobs or collaborators on data science projects. Anyone can say they know how to code -- a portfolio shows it's true.
  3. Thought it's not Python, you'll need to understand some fundamentals about how code works to write your website. Code has a **syntax** that is more structured than written language, which you'll be able observe that while using Markdown and HTML. Code is also built to be able to do similar tasks repeatedly by changing **parameters**. Keep an eye out for these concepts as you work through this challenge!


::: {.callout-task}
Before we meet at our in-person training in Boulder, you will need to:

  1. Build and publish your portfolio page
  2. Write about yourself and your interest in environmental data science
  2. Add at least one image
  
You can optionally add additional formatting and a theme to your webpage. We'll work through adding a map to your page together -- but you're welcome to try it out yourself if you need an extra challenge! We've provided a lot of resources here to help you, including written descriptions, screenshots, and video demos. However, don't hesitate to reach out to your faculty or us if you run into a problem.
