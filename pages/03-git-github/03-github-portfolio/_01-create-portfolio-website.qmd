# STEP 1: Create your own portfolio webpage

  <a href="www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is a powerful software development tool owned and operated by Microsoft. It is used almost universally for software development and scientific projects. It lets you:

  * Keep track of all the changes you have ever made, when, and why
  * Collaborate with others
  * Get your code online so you can access it anywhere
  * Use a cloud platform to run your code
  * Publish a website in minutes
  
We'll be focusing on that last feature in this activity, in which you will create and publish your own online portfolio website. Read more about `git` and `GitHub` in our open [**Earth Data Science** textbook pages](/pages/03-git-github/01-intro-version-control/01-intro-version-control.qmd).

## STEP 1A: Create a GitHub account

Use [**this link**](https://github.com/signup) to create a free GitHub account.

::: {.callout-warning}
If you already have a GitHub account, there is no need to create a new account!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## STEP 1B: Create a repository

Once you have a GitHub account, get started by creating a new **repository** for your webpage. There are several ways to accomplish this task.

::: {.callout-warning}
Sometimes buttons on GitHub are blue instead of green.
:::

::: {.callout-tip .column-margin title="What is a **repository**?"}

A GitHub **repository** is a collection of code, documentation, and configuration files. All changes you make in a repository will be tracked using the version control system **git**. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
:::

To do this you can: 

  1. Navigate to your profile page 
  2. Click on the dropdown arrow next to your profile photo in the upper right corner 
  3. Select `Your profile`

      ![Select `Your profile`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/your-profile.png)

  4.  Select the **Repositories** tab from the menu near the top of the page.
     
      ![Select the **Repositories** tab from the menu near the top of the page.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/repositories.png)

  5.  From here, you can select the green **New** button on the right to get started.

      ![Select the green **New** button on the right to get started](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/new-repo.png)

  6.  Customize the settings:
  
      * Give your repository a short and descriptive name. We recommend `<yourusername>.github.io` because it results in the simplest url for your website.
      * Give your repository a **description** 
      * Make your repository **Public** 
      * You can skip adding the **gitignore** file for now
      * Add a README so your repository home page (on GitHub, NOT your published website) will include your title and description
      * Choose a **License** for your repository. Check out <a href="https://choosealicense.com" target="_blank">choosealicense.com</a> for more information about popular options. 

  7. Once you're done, select the green **Create Repository** button at the bottom of the page

::: {.callout-tip .column-margin}
### Speak Code
When reading code snippets, the `<` and `>` symbols are usually used to surround text you should replace. **Do not leave the `<` and `>` symbols in place!**. For example, in this case your repository name would be `jdoe.github.io`, if `jdoe` was your GitHub username. *There's a BIG exception to this rule when it comes to building websites -- `<` and `>` are key characters if you are using HTML.*
:::

::: {.callout-important .column-margin}
### Licenses

A license, copyright, and data rights or data sovereignty are all slightly different. A license is about whether and how someone else can use the code in your repository. Copyright is about the text published on your website, and data rights are about whether and how others can use your data
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## STEP 1C: Create a new `index.md` file

You will create a new file called `index.md` that will serve as the content for your webpage. To do this you can : 

  1. Select the **Add file** button from the menu on the right 
  2. Select **Create new file**.

     ![Select **Create new file**.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/create-new-file.png)

  3.  Name your new **Markdown** file `index.md`. This will make it the home page of your website. Then, add a **Markdown header** text to your index file, e.g.

```markdown
# A fabulous Earth Data Science Portfolio
```

::: callout-note
You can change this text to your name or something else. This is ***your*** website, and you'll always be able to come back and make edits!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## STEP 1D: Commit changes

Now that you've created your `index.md` file and added some text, you'll want to **commit changes** to your repository. Add an optional extended description of your changes and then select the green **Commit changes** button at the bottom of the page.

![Commit changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/commit-changes.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## STEP 1E: Build your webpage

Once you've created your `index.md` file you're ready to build your webpage:

  1. From your repository, select the **Settings** tab from the right end of the menu.

     ![Navigate to your repository settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/settings.png)

  2. From here, scroll down the menu on the **left** and select **Pages**.

     ![Select the Pages settings tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/pages.png)

  3. Now you'll want to select the **main** option under the **Branch** heading and then select **Save**.

     ![Select the main branch in your repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/select-branch-main.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## STEP 1F: Check on your webpage

Check in on your webpage to see how it is doing by opening the link **`https://username.github.io/`** in a **new tab** in your web browser. Here, you'll need to replace `username` with your GitHub username. Once you see your name (or whatever text you added to your `index.md` file in **Step 2**) appear as a Markdown header, then you know your webpage is working!

::: {.callout-note}
Sometimes your webpage can take a minute or so to build so *be patient* and refresh every 30 seconds or so until the page is done building. You can track the progress in the `Actions` tab.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## STEP 1G: Start adding information to your webpage

::: {.callout-note .column-margin}
Review the [**Markdown Basic Syntax guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) to help you format your webpage using **`Markdown`** and **`HTML`**. We also have a [**lesson** in our **Earth Data Science** textbook](/pages/02-file-formats-eds/04-text-file-formats-eds/02-markdown.qmd) that may be helpful.
:::

Now you're ready to start adding some more information to your webpage. Navigate back to your repository and open the `index.md` file that you just created. You will edit this page by clicking on the **pencil** icon on the right of the menu near the top of your repository page on GitHub. You will use **Markdown** and **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** to add text, links, images, and other content to your webpage. Markdown and HTML are both common markup langauges, and have wide application including formatting text, report writing, and website development.

![Edit a file on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-student-webpages/main/images/edit-file.png)

### Here you should think about adding the following information to your webpage:

-   Your name (as a ***header***) if you haven't already
-   A **bulleted list** of links to your public **contact information** (email, GitHub account, LinkedIn account, social media accounts, etc.)
-   Your educational and professional background
-   A **biographical paragraph** about yourself
-   What you're **excited about learning** about **Earth Data Science**
-   **Questions** that you'd like to answer using **Earth Data Science**

You should also plan to add a photo of yourself and/or where you live. We'll go over how to add and customize images on your page in the next two lessons.

::: callout-warning
Always remember to **commit changes** so that your updated content gets added to your webpage.
