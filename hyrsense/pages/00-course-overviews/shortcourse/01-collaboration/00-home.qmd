  GitHub is the platform that hosts most open science projects. If you use an open science tool -- like Python, geopandas or rioxarray for example -- you can probably find it on GitHub! We like to teach students GitHub early on so that they can feel like part of the open science community from the start.
learning-goals:
  - Get started sharing your science online
  - Explain to students why version control and online collaboration tools are important for open science
  - Learn how to use and modify text-based data files
