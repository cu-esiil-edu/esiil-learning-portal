title: Spring returns to the Great Plains
subtitle: Mapping Tasiyagnunpa migration
description: |
  Tasiyagnunpa (or Western Meadowlark, or *sturnella neglecta*) migrates each year to nest on the Great Plains in the United States. Using crowd-sourced observations of these birds, we can see that migration happening throughout the year. In the process, you''ll learn about an important type of geospatial data called **vector data**, which records where points, lines, and shapes on the Earth.
learning-goals:
  - Combine different types of vector data with spatial joins
  - Normalize species observation data to avoid collection biases
  - Create a chloropleth plot
  - Build an interactive display showing observation distributions over time

Before we get started, let's define some parameters for the workflow. We'll use these throughout to customize the workflow for this species:

```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
id = 'stars'
species_name = 'Tasiyagnunpa'
species_lookup = 'sturnella neglecta'
species_key = 9596413
year = 2023
gbif_filename = 'gbif_tasiyagnunpa.csv'
plot_filename = 'tasiyagnunpa_migration'
plot_height = 500
```
