title: Spring returns to the Great Plains
subtitle: Mapping Tasiyagnunpa migration
description: 'Tasiyagnunpa (or Western Meadowlark, or *sturnella neglecta*) migrates
  each year to nest on the Great Plains in the United States. Using crowd-sourced
  observations of these birds, we can see that migration happening throughout the
  year. In the process, you''ll learn about an important type of geospatial data called
  **vector data**, which records where points, lines, and shapes on the Earth.

  '
learning-goals:
- Combine different types of vector data with spatial joins
- Normalize species observation data to avoid collection biases
- Create a chloropleth plot
- Build an interactive display showing observation distributions over time
