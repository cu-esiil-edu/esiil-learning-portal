Before we get started, let's define some parameters. You can use these if you want to change how the workflow runs from the top:

```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
id = 'css'
location = 'Chicago, IL'
station_id = 'USW00094846'
start_date = '1950-10-01'
end_date = '2023-09-30'
output_filename = 'climate-chicago-data.csv'
```
