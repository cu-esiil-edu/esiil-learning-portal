Before we get started, let's define some parameters. You can use these if you want to change how the workflow runs from the top:

```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
id = 'foundations'
project_dirname = 'climate-boulder'
ncei_filename = 'ncei-climate-boulder.csv'
location = 'Boulder, CO'
station_id = 'USC00050848'
start_date = '1893-10-01'
end_date = '2023-09-30'
data_type = 'TOBS'
```
