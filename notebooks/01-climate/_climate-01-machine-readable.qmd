## Human-readable and Machine-readable

When writing open, reproducible scientific workflows, it is always important to make sure that:

  1. all collaborators can understand what's going on
  2. any commands you give to a computer are clear and unambiguous

We call these two (sometimes competing) goals **human-readability** and **machine-readability**.
