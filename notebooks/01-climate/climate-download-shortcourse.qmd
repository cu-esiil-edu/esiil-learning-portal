Before we get started, let's define some parameters. You can use these if you want to change how the workflow runs from the top:

```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
id = 'shortcourse'
project_dirname = 'climate-karachi'
ncei_filename = 'ncei-climate-karachi.csv'
location = 'Karachi, Pakistan'
station_id = 'PKM00041780'
start_date = '1942-10-01'
end_date = '2024-09-30'
data_type = 'TAVG'
```
