## Pick a new location and/or measurement to plot üåè üìà

Recreate the workflow you just did in a place that interests you OR with a different measurement. You will need to make your own new Markdown and Code cells below this one, or create a new notebook.

Your analysis should include:

  1. A researched (with citations or links) **site description**, including *why* you chose the site
  2. A researched (with citations or links) **data description**, including a **data citation**
  3. A researched (with citations or links) **methods overview**
  4. Some kind of **visual evidence** (plot, chart, diagram) for your results
  5. A **headline and description** for the visual evidence that *interprets* your analysis and puts it *in context*

You should also delete the instructions before posting a portfolio page.
