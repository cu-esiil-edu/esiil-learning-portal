Before we get started, let's define some parameters. You can use these if you want to change how the workflow runs from the top:

```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
id = 'shortcourse'
location = 'Rapid City, SD'
station_id = 'USC00396947'
start_date = '1949-10-01'
end_date = '2023-09-30'
output_filename = 'climate-shortcourse-data.csv'
```

{{< include _climate-32-wrangle.qmd >}}

{{< include _climate-33-units.qmd >}}

{{< include _climate-34-plot.qmd >}}

{{< include _climate-40-wrapup.qmd >}}
