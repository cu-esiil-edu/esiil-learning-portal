  In March 2019, large parts of South Dakota were flooded for weeks. What happened to cause this flooding? What were the impacts on local communities? We will use environmental data to determine where and when flooding happened and how long it lasted. Then, we'll use that same data to put the floods in context historically and discuss how to plan for future disasters.
goals:
  - Use time-series streamflow data from the USGS to identify when flooding occurred
  - Examine potential causes for flooding
  - Describe the impacts of flooding on infrastructure, people, and communities
