## Observing vegetation health from space

We will look at vegetation health using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). How does it work? First, we need to learn about spectral reflectance signatures.

Every object reflects some wavelengths of light more or less than others. We can see this with our eyes, since, for example, plants reflect a lot of green in the summer, and then as that green diminishes in the fall they look more yellow or orange. The image below shows spectral signatures for water, soil, and vegetation:

**Healthy vegetation** reflects a lot of **Near-InfraRed (NIR)** radiation. Less healthy vegetation reflects a similar amounts of the visible light spectra, but less NIR radiation. We don't see a huge drop in Green radiation until the plant is very stressed or dead. That means that NIR allows us to get ahead of what we can see with our eyes.

Different species of plants reflect different spectral signatures, but the *pattern* of the signatures across species and sitations is similar. NDVI compares the amount of NIR reflectance to the amount of Red reflectance, thus accounting for many of the species differences and isolating the health of the plant. The formula for calculating NDVI is:

$$NDVI = \frac{(NIR - Red)}{(NIR + Red)}$$
