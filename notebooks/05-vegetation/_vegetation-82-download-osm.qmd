# Download Study Area

You can use any boundary for your study. One great way to get political boundaries is through the Open Street Map API. Open Street Map is an open-source, editable map of the world -- a little like a wiki for places. They also provide a service (or API) for looking up locations using code.

## Search online

It can be a little tricky to find the place you want using the OSM API. We recommend that you start out on the [Open Street Map (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) web page, and search for your site there. Then, you can get key pieces of information you will need to reproducibly find your site area using code.

In this example, we are downloading images to match [these images from NASA](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/11290). 

### STEP 1A: Navigate to Open Street Map

### STEP 1B: Search for a nearby landmark

We'll start by searching for the town of Tubarjal.

![Select the first result.](/img/earth-analytics/irrigation/osm-saudi-arabia/02-search-result.png)

### STEP 1C: Select the region

We'll need and area, not just a point, as a site boundary.

![Scroll down on the side bar and select the Al Jawr region.](/img/earth-analytics/irrigation/osm-saudi-arabia/03-select-region.png)
Make a note of the name of the region, as well as at least one of the tags, for later.
