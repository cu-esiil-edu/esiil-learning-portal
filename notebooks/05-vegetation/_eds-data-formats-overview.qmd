### Earth Data Science data formats

In Earth Data Science, we get data in three main formats:

| Data type | Descriptions | Common file formats | Python type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time Series | The same data points (e.g. streamflow) collected multiple times over time | Tabular formats (e.g. .csv, or .xlsx) | pandas DataFrame |
| Vector | Points, lines, and areas (with coordinates) | Shapefile (often an archive like a `.zip` file because a Shapefile is actually a collection of at least 3 files) | geopandas GeoDataFrame |
| Raster | Evenly spaced spatial grid (with coordinates) | GeoTIFF (`.tif`), NetCDF (`.nc`), HDF (`.hdf`) | rioxarray DataArray |
