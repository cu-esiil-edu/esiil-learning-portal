# STEP 1: Site map

## Study Area: {{< meta params.site_name >}}

::: {.callout-respond}
For this coding challenge, we are interested in the boundary of the {{< meta params.site_name >}}, and the health of vegetation in the area measured on a scale from -1 to 1. In the cell below, answer the following question: **What data type do you think the boundary will be? What about the vegetation health?**

### Load the {{< meta params.site_name >}} boundary

::: {.callout-task}

  - Locate the boundary files in your download directory
  - Change `'boundary-directory'` to the actual location
  - Load the data into Python and check that it worked

:::

```{python}
#| template: student
# Load in the boundary data
boundary_gdf = gpd.read_file(
    project.project_dir / 'boundary-directory')
# Check that it worked

```

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
```{python}
#| template: answer
# Load in the boundary data
boundary_gdf = gpd.read_file(
    project.project_dir / boundary_dir)
# Check that it worked
boundary_gdf

```
:::



```{python}
#| template: student
# Plot the results with web tile images
boundary_gdf.hvplot()
```

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
```{python}
#| template: answer
# Plot the results with web tile images
boundary_gdf.hvplot(
    geo=True, tiles='EsriImagery',
    fill_color=None, line_color='black',
    title=site_name,
    frame_width=500)
```
