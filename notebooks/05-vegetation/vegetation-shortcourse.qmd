# STEP 0: Set up

First, you can use the following parameters to change things about the workflow:

```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
id = 'shortcourse'
site_name = 'Tubarjal Valley Saudi Arabia'
project_name = 'Tubarjal Valley Saudi Arabia Irrigation'
boundary_dir = 'tubarjal-valley'
event = 'groundwater irrigation'
start_year = '2001'
end_year = '2022'
event_year = '2012'
```
