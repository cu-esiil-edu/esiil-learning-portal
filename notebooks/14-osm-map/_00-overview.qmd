## About Spatial Vector Data

Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x and y values, or latitude and longitude) that define the “shape” of the spatial object. The organization of the vertices determines the type of vector that you are working with. There are three fundamental types of vector data:

**Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate. Examples of point data include: sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.

**Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This line is composed of a series of segments, each bend in the road or stream represents a vertex that has defined x, y location.

**Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and closed. Thus, the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or countries are often represented by polygons.

### Open this activity in GitHub Codespaces

To complete this activity, you will need somewhere to run your code. Start by going to this [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cu-esiil-edu/first-map-template/). We've set it up so that anyone can run Python code from there!

Once you are on the website, follow these instructions to get your Codespace up and running:

  1. Click on Use this Template in the upper right, and select Open in Codespace. This might take a minute if you haven't done it in awhile.
  2. Once the Codespace loads, open `!00-first-map.ipynb` using the `Folders` tab on the left-hand side.
  3. Continue working through the sample notebook. All the code should start off the same as what is on this page, but there's more background information here if you want it.
  4. Once you are done, [stop your Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/stopping-and-starting-a-codespace#stopping-a-codespace) so you don't use up your allocation!

### Finding locations and boundaries

[Open Street Map (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is an open-source, editable map of the world -- a little like a wiki for places. They also provide a service for looking up locations using text, which we'll be using in this activity.
