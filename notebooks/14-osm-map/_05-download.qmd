# STEP 3: Save your OSM download

The Open Street Map API is pretty reliable, and it caches the results automatically to avoid multiple downloads. However, you still might want to save your download, for example to distribute as part of a data release or reproducible workflow.


```{python}
#| warning: false
# Create path for boundary
boundary_path = project.project_dir / boundary_dirname
# Can't overwrite existing files, which seems to be an intractable GDAL issue
if boundary_path.exists():
    shutil.rmtree(boundary_path)

# Write OSM result to shapefile
boundary_gdf.to_file(boundary_path)
```
