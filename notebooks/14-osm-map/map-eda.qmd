  As Earth and Environmental Data Scientists, we know places are important. In this activity, you will make your first map in Python, and use it to tell the story of where you come from and what places are important to you.
learning-goals: 
  - Define geospatial vector data
  - Search for geospatial features
  - Construct a map and embed it into a portfolio website

Before we get started, let's define some parameters in Python that we can use to change the workflow:

```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
id = 'shortcourse'
address = 'University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, United States'
tag_key = 'amenity'
tag_value = 'university'
long_name = 'University of Colorado Boulder'
short_name = 'CU Boulder'
map_filename = 'cu-boulder.html'
```
