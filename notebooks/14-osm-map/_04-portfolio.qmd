# STEP 3: Download your map from Codespaces

If you are doing this activity on GitHub Codespaces or another cloud service, you will need to download the map you created:

  1. Open the `Folders` tab on the left hand side
  2. Right-click on `{{< meta params.map_filename >}}` (or whatever you named your file)
  3. Select `Download...`

This should download your map.

# STEP 4: Place your map in your webpage

You are now ready to upload your map to your portfolio repository and place it in your webpage. Because it is HTML and not an image, you will need to use the following HTML to get it on your page:

```markdown
<embed type="text/html" src="{{< meta params.map_filename >}}" width="600" height="600">
```

```{=html}
<embed type="text/html" src="{{< meta params.map_filename >}}" width="600" height="600">
```

Make sure to make the `width` and `height` of your `embed` element larger than the `frame_width` and `frame_height` of your plot, or it will get cut off!
