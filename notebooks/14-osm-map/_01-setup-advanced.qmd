# STEP 0: Import Mapping packages

To access the Open Street Map API, we'll use the osmnx package.

:::{.callout-task}
Add code to import the other necessary libraries to:

  1. Create interactive maps and plots
  2. Save maps and plots to .html files
  
:::

```{python}
#| template: student
# Save maps and plots to HTML files
# Create interactive maps and plots
from osmnx import features as osm # Search for locations by name
```

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
```{python}
#| template: answer
import holoviews as hv # Save maps and plots to HTML files
import hvplot.pandas # Create interactive maps and plots
from osmnx import features as osm # Search for locations by name
```
