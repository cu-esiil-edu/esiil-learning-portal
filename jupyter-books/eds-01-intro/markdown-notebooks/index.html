<p>Jupyter Book also lets you write text-based notebooks using MyST Markdown.
See <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/myst-notebooks.html">the Notebooks with MyST Markdown documentation</a> for more detailed instructions.
This page shows off a notebook written in MyST Markdown.</p>

<h2 id="an-example-cell">An example cell</h2>

<p>With MyST Markdown, you can define code cells with a directive like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{code-cell}">print(2 + 2)
</code></pre>

<p>When your book is built, the contents of any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{code-cell}</code> blocks will be
executed with your default Jupyter kernel, and their outputs will be displayed
in-line with the rest of your content.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{seealso}">Jupyter Book uses [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert text-based files to notebooks, and can support [many other text-based notebook files](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/jupytext.html).

<h2 id="create-a-notebook-with-myst-markdown">Create a notebook with MyST Markdown</h2>

<p>MyST Markdown notebooks are defined by two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>YAML metadata that is needed to understand if / how it should convert text files to notebooks (including information about the kernel needed).
See the YAML at the top of this page for example.</li>
  <li>The presence of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{code-cell}</code> directives, which will be executed with your book.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s all that is needed to get started!</p>

<h2 id="quickly-add-yaml-metadata-for-myst-notebooks">Quickly add YAML metadata for MyST Notebooks</h2>

<p>If you have a markdown file and you’d like to quickly add YAML metadata to it, so that Jupyter Book will treat it as a MyST Markdown Notebook, run the following command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jupyter-book myst init path/to/markdownfile.md
</code></pre></div></div>
