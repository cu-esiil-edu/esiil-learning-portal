    "text": "Through this 4-week, project-based data short course, Earth Science educators and leaders will learn how to inclusively engage learners in:\n\nUnderstanding and unlocking the potential of EDS empower their communities\nContributing to sustainable, collaborative EDS projects\nTelling their community’s data stories\n\nParticipants will engage in a series of trainings that prepare them to include open science (Python) and collaboration tools (GitHub, including GitHub Classroom, GitHub Codespaces, and GitHub Pages) into their curriculum or existing research model. We will emphasize working with key types of environmental data (time series, vector, and raster), and using cloud computing to enhance access to Earth Data Science education. At the end of the data short course, participants will be expected to create a lesson that applies lessons learned to a class or project that they are currently working on."
