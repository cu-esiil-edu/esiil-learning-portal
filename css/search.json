Overnight temperatures in Chicago were forecast to stay into the 70’s with record breaking temperatures being attributed to climate change.\n\n\n\nSource: NOAA, Magenta indicates the highest risk of extreme heat on Monday June 17, 2024\n\n\nIf you teach in or near Chicago, your students probably have some feelings about how hot it was! The Chicago area is known for its at times extreme weather, but cities get hit particularly hard by heat waves due to the urban heat island effect. This article from WGN (Alix Martichoux 2024) explains what this means for cities like Chicago.\n\nHeat kills\nClimate change is intensifying summer heat in Chicago, particularly in heat island areas, which disproportionately affects marginalized communities. These neighborhoods, often with less green space and more heat-trapping infrastructure, face higher temperatures and greater health risks (US EPA 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More: What is a Heat Island?\n\n\n\nRead more about the Urban Heat Island effect at the EPA.\n\n\nChicago O’Hare International Airport is a known heat island often reporting temperatures 5-10 degrees warmer than surrounding communities (NBC Chicago 2022).\n\n\nIs it cooler by the lake?\nMany Chicagoans know that one of the best ways to beat the heat is to head to the lake. In this we’ll try to answer whether it’s really cooler by the Lake, and what Chicago could do to cool down the rest of the City.\n\n\n\nWGN Temperature Forecast – it’s cooler by the lake!\n\n\nWe will select two climate stations located within the greater Chicago area: O’Hare International Airport (Station ID: USW00094846), and Northerly Island (Station ID: USC00111550) to explore trends in maximum daily temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of O’Hare Airport by Miguel Angel Sanz - Unsplash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAerial view of Northerly Island.

    "text": "How Do You Make Your Work More Open and Reproducible?\nThe list below are things that you can begin to do to make your work more open and reproducible. It can be overwhelming to think about doing everything at once. However, each item is something that you could work towards.\n\nUse Scientific Programming to Process Data\nScientific programming allows you to automate tasks, which facilitates your workflows to be quickly run and replicated. In contrast, graphical user interface (GUI) based workflows require interactive manual steps for processing, which become more difficult and time consuming to reproduce. If you use an open source programming language like Python or R, then anyone has access to your methods. However, if you use a tool that requires a license, then people without the resources to purchase that tool are excluded from fully reproducing your workflow.\n\n\nUse Expressive Names for Files and Directories to Organize Your Work\nExpressive file and directory names allow you to quickly find what you need and also support reproducibility by facilitating others’ understanding of your files and workflows (e.g. names can tell others what the file or directory contains and its purpose). Be sure to organize related files into directories (i.e. folders) that can help you easily categorize and find what you need (e.g. raw-data, scripts, results).\n\n\nUse FAIR Data to Enhance the Reproducibility of Projects\nMake sure that the data used in your project adhere to the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016), so that they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable, and there is documentation on how to access them and what they contain. FAIR principles also extend beyond the raw data to apply to the tools and workflows that are used to process and create new data. FAIR principles enhance the reproducibility of projects by supporting the reuse and expansion of your data and workflows, which contributes to greater discovery within the scientific community.\n\n\nProtect Your Raw Data\nDon’t modify (or overwrite) the raw data. Keep data outputs separate from inputs, so that you can easily re-run your workflow as needed. This is easily done if you organize your data into directories that separate the raw data from your results, etc.\n\n\nUse Version Control and Share Your Code (If You Can)\nVersion control allows you to manage and track changes to your files (and even undo them!). If you can openly share your code, implement version control and then publish your code and workflows on the cloud. There are many free tools to do this including Git and GitHub.\n\n\nDocument Your Workflows\nDocumentation can mean many different things. It can be as basic as including (carefully crafted and to the point) comments throughout your code to explain the specific steps of your workflow. Documentation can also mean using tools such as Jupyter Notebooks or RMarkdown files to include a text narrative in Markdown format that is interspersed with code to provide high level explanation of a workflow.\nDocumentation can also include docstrings, which provide standardized documentation of Python functions, or even README files that describe the bigger picture of your workflow, directory structure, data, processing, and outputs.\n\n\nDesign Workflows That Can Be Easily Recreated\nYou can design workflows that can be easily recreated and reproduced by others by: * listing all packages and dependencies required to run a workflow at the top of the code file (e.g. Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown files). * organizing your code into sections, or code blocks, of related code and include comments to explain the code. * creating reusuable environments for Python workflows using tools like docker containers, conda environments, and interactive notebooks with binder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Reproducible Science - A Case Study\n\n\n\nChaya is a scientist at Generic University, studying the role of invasive grasses on fires in grassland areas. She is building models of fire spread as they relate to vegetation cover. This model uses data collected from satellites that detect wildfires and also plant cover maps. After documenting that an invasive plant drastically alters fire spread rates, she is eager to share her findings with the world. Chaya uses scientific programming rather than a graphical user interface tool such as Excel to process her data and run the model to ensure that the process is automated. Chaya writes a manuscript on her findings. When she is ready to submit her article to a journal, she first posts a preprint of the article on a preprint server, stores relevant data in a data repository and releases her code on GitHub. This way, the research community can provide feedback on her work, the reviewers and others can reproduce her analysis, and she has established precedent for her findings.\nIn the first review of her paper, which is returned 3 months later, many changes are suggested which impact her final figures. Updating figures could be a tedious process. However, in this case, Chaya has developed these figures using the Python programming language. Thus, updating figures is easily done by modifying the processing methods used to create them. Further because she stored her data and code in a public repository on GitHub, it is easy and quick for Chaya three months later to find the original data and code that she used and to update the workflow as needed to produce the revised versions of her figures. Throughout the review process, the code (and perhaps data) are updated, and new versions of the code are tracked. Upon acceptance of the manuscript, the preprint can be updated, along with the code and data to ensure that the most recent version of the paper and analysis are openly available for anyone to use.",
