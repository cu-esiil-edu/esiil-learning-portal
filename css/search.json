Located about 14 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, it offers flights to more than 200 destinations and handles over 83 million passengers annually.

We could work with that, but to make things go smoother (and learn how to work with DataFrames) we can join them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s a join?\n\n\n\nThere are a few different ways to combine DataFrames in Python. A join combines two DataFrames by their index (the dates in our case), checking to make sure that every date matches. In our case, we could concatenate instead without checking the dates, because all the dates are the same for our two DataFrames. That would probably be faster! But also, we think it is more error-prone. For example, it might not tell you that something was wrong if you accidentally downloaded data from two different years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry It: Join two `DataFrame`s\n\n\n\nStarting with the sample code below:\n\nReplace left_df with the name of the first DataFrame. In this case, it doesn’t matter which one you choose to be on the left, but you need to make sure that it matches the left suffix label (lsuffix).\nReplace right_df with the name of the second DataFrame, making sure it matches rsuffix.\nRun the code and check that your join happened correctly.\n\n\n\n\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    left_df\n    .join(\n        right_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()\n\n\n\nSee our solution!\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    ohare_tmax_df\n    .join(\n        northerly_tmax_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTMAX_ohare\nTMAX_northerly\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-06-01\n68\n67\n\n\n2024-06-02\n77\n67\n\n\n2024-06-03\n86\n85\n\n\n2024-06-04\n85\n77\n\n\n2024-06-05\n79\n79"

Most things about hte plot we can change by passing parameters to the .plot() method (see below). However, we think the easiest way to change the legend labels in Python is to rename the columns. Python will automatically use the column names as legend labels just like it did in the first plot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOnce we rename columns to non-machine-readable names that include spaces and special characters, they will be harder to work with in Python.

Communities need to protect their vulnerable members by adapting to the changing climate with solutions informed by their cultural, geographic, and political context.\n\n\nBecause this is a place-based learning exercise, it can be adapted to different cultural contexts. This is a key element we hear about when asking communities how to teach Earth Data Science in a culturally responsive way.\n\n\n\nSource: https://successfulacademics.com/BlackChildSEL/CRT.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversation Starter\n\n\n\nHeat affects different communities in different ways. Here are some questions to help spark a conversation with classmates or with members of your community:\n\nWhat effects has heat had on your community?\nWhat changes have you observed to the climate over your lifetime? Can you talk to an elder and find out what changes they have observed?\nHow have policies like redlining influenced community vulnerability to heat waves?\nAre there traditional building methods or ecological practices in your culture that help to mitigate the effects of heat waves?\n\n\n\nWe know it can be tough to talk about climate change – be easy on yourselves! One way to help have a positive conversation about climate change is to talk about solutions. After all, when it comes to a life-or-death issue like heat waves, we can’t let the conversation end with observing the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversation Starter\n\n\n\nWhat are some short- and long-term strategies for mitigating the effects of heat on your community? If you were implementing mitigation strategies, who would you reach out to first? Below are some examples of some types of strategies you could discuss:\n\nReaching out to vulnerable community members through cultural and religious institutions to provide aid such as transportation to an air conditioned space, ensure water supply, and cool down buildings with strategies like fans and radiation-blocking window films.\nCulturally and climatically appropriate changes to the built environment to reduce heat absorption and storage during heat waves.\nCulturally and climatically appropriate changes and/or expansion of green space to reduce heat absorption and storage\nCultural events to help your community adapt\n\n\n\nMaking cultural connections is important for achieving learning goals and engaging diverse groups of students.\n\n\n\nWe have also developed this activity so that it can be adapted to many different academic disciplines, and we encourage you to do so in your classes! For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscipline\nLearning Goals\n\n\n\n\nPhysics\nExplain how aspects of heat transfer such asalbedo, thermal mass, and latent heat relate to the Urban Heat Island effect\n\n\nBiology\nBiological concepts that cause the Urban Heat Island effect such as transpiration, photosynthesis, and homeostasis\n\n\nStatistics\nProbability distributions for average and extreme temperatures, stationarity, and hypothesis testing to determine differences among sites\n\n\nCalculus\nProcesses governing heat transfer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More: Air Temperature vs. Surface Temperature\n\n\n\nWe’ll be looking at air temperature in this analysis rather than surface temperature. Some of you may have clocked that the surface temperature is more related to the Urban Heat Island mechanism! However, the two are closely related, so we think we can still examing Urban Heat Island effects using air temperature. Check out this resource from the EPA (US EPA 2014) on the relationship between air temperature and surface temperature and the Urban Heat Island effect:"

    "text": "How Do You Make Your Work More Open and Reproducible?\nThe list below are things that you can begin to do to make your work more open and reproducible. It can be overwhelming to think about doing everything at once. However, each item is something that you could work towards.\n\nUse Scientific Programming to Process Data\nScientific programming allows you to automate tasks, which facilitates your workflows to be quickly run and replicated. In contrast, graphical user interface (GUI) based workflows require interactive manual steps for processing, which become more difficult and time consuming to reproduce. If you use an open source programming language like Python or R, then anyone has access to your methods. However, if you use a tool that requires a license, then people without the resources to purchase that tool are excluded from fully reproducing your workflow.\n\n\nUse Expressive Names for Files and Directories to Organize Your Work\nExpressive file and directory names allow you to quickly find what you need and also support reproducibility by facilitating others’ understanding of your files and workflows (e.g. names can tell others what the file or directory contains and its purpose). Be sure to organize related files into directories (i.e. folders) that can help you easily categorize and find what you need (e.g. raw-data, scripts, results).\n\n\nUse FAIR Data to Enhance the Reproducibility of Projects\nMake sure that the data used in your project adhere to the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016), so that they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable, and there is documentation on how to access them and what they contain. FAIR principles also extend beyond the raw data to apply to the tools and workflows that are used to process and create new data. FAIR principles enhance the reproducibility of projects by supporting the reuse and expansion of your data and workflows, which contributes to greater discovery within the scientific community.\n\n\nProtect Your Raw Data\nDon’t modify (or overwrite) the raw data. Keep data outputs separate from inputs, so that you can easily re-run your workflow as needed. This is easily done if you organize your data into directories that separate the raw data from your results, etc.\n\n\nUse Version Control and Share Your Code (If You Can)\nVersion control allows you to manage and track changes to your files (and even undo them!). If you can openly share your code, implement version control and then publish your code and workflows on the cloud. There are many free tools to do this including Git and GitHub.\n\n\nDocument Your Workflows\nDocumentation can mean many different things. It can be as basic as including (carefully crafted and to the point) comments throughout your code to explain the specific steps of your workflow. Documentation can also mean using tools such as Jupyter Notebooks or RMarkdown files to include a text narrative in Markdown format that is interspersed with code to provide high level explanation of a workflow.\nDocumentation can also include docstrings, which provide standardized documentation of Python functions, or even README files that describe the bigger picture of your workflow, directory structure, data, processing, and outputs.\n\n\nDesign Workflows That Can Be Easily Recreated\nYou can design workflows that can be easily recreated and reproduced by others by: * listing all packages and dependencies required to run a workflow at the top of the code file (e.g. Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown files). * organizing your code into sections, or code blocks, of related code and include comments to explain the code. * creating reusuable environments for Python workflows using tools like docker containers, conda environments, and interactive notebooks with binder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Reproducible Science - A Case Study\n\n\n\nChaya is a scientist at Generic University, studying the role of invasive grasses on fires in grassland areas. She is building models of fire spread as they relate to vegetation cover. This model uses data collected from satellites that detect wildfires and also plant cover maps. After documenting that an invasive plant drastically alters fire spread rates, she is eager to share her findings with the world. Chaya uses scientific programming rather than a graphical user interface tool such as Excel to process her data and run the model to ensure that the process is automated. Chaya writes a manuscript on her findings. When she is ready to submit her article to a journal, she first posts a preprint of the article on a preprint server, stores relevant data in a data repository and releases her code on GitHub. This way, the research community can provide feedback on her work, the reviewers and others can reproduce her analysis, and she has established precedent for her findings.\nIn the first review of her paper, which is returned 3 months later, many changes are suggested which impact her final figures. Updating figures could be a tedious process. However, in this case, Chaya has developed these figures using the Python programming language. Thus, updating figures is easily done by modifying the processing methods used to create them. Further because she stored her data and code in a public repository on GitHub, it is easy and quick for Chaya three months later to find the original data and code that she used and to update the workflow as needed to produce the revised versions of her figures. Throughout the review process, the code (and perhaps data) are updated, and new versions of the code are tracked. Upon acceptance of the manuscript, the preprint can be updated, along with the code and data to ensure that the most recent version of the paper and analysis are openly available for anyone to use.",

Some of these sensors have been recording data for over a century! For this activity, we’ll get daily maximum temperature measurements from the Global Historical Climate Network daily (Menne et al. 2012), an openly available and extensively validated global network of temperature sensors.\n\n\n\nThe Global Historical Climatology Network Source: CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2084097\n\n\nThe GHCNd data are available through by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Climate Data Online search tool.

Located about 14 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, it offers flights to more than 200 destinations and handles over 83 million passengers annually. It is home to Chicago’s official meteorological station.

It also displays as plain text instead of a formatted table, so you can easily tell the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Select only the TMAX column of the O'Hare data\ntmax_df = df[['column_name']]\ntmax_df.describe()\n\n\n# Select only the TMAX column of the Northerly data\ntmax_df = df[['column_name']]\ntmax_df.describe()\n\n\n\nSee our solution!\nohare_tmax_df = ohare_df[['TMAX']]\nnortherly_tmax_df = northerly_df[['TMAX']]\nohare_tmax_df.describe(), northerly_tmax_df.describe()\n\n\n(            TMAX\n count  30.000000\n mean   83.566667\n std     8.122694\n min    68.000000\n 25%    78.000000\n 50%    85.000000\n 75%    90.250000\n max    97.000000,\n             TMAX\n count  30.000000\n mean   79.900000\n std     8.738934\n min    63.000000\n 25%    74.250000\n 50%    78.500000\n 75%    88.000000\n max    94.000000)\n\n\n\n\nJoin data\nRight now, we have data from two stations in two separate DataFrames. We could work with that, but to make things go smoother (and learn how to work with DataFrames) we can join them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s a join?\n\n\n\nThere are a few different ways to combine DataFrames in Python. A join combines two DataFrames by their index (the dates in our case), checking to make sure that every date matches. In our case, we could concatenate instead without checking the dates, because all the dates are the same for our two DataFrames. That would probably be faster! But also, we think it is more error-prone. For example, it might not tell you that something was wrong if you accidentally downloaded data from two different years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry It: Join two `DataFrame`s\n\n\n\nStarting with the sample code below:\n\nReplace left_df with the name of the first DataFrame. In this case, it doesn’t matter which one you choose to be on the left, but you need to make sure that it matches the left suffix label (lsuffix).\nReplace right_df with the name of the second DataFrame, making sure it matches rsuffix.\nRun the code and check that your join happened correctly.\n\n\n\n\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    left_df\n    .join(\n        right_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()\n\n\n\nSee our solution!\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    ohare_tmax_df\n    .join(\n        northerly_tmax_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTMAX_ohare\nTMAX_northerly\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-06-01\n68\n67\n\n\n2024-06-02\n77\n67\n\n\n2024-06-03\n86\n85\n\n\n2024-06-04\n85\n77\n\n\n2024-06-05\n79\n79",

However, this plot is missing some key elements, and is sadly lacking in style.\n\nWhat do you notice about this plot that you would like to change for a final figure?\n\n\nRename columns for nicer labels\nSomething you might have noticed about your plot is that the labels in the legend don’t look very nice. Most things about hte plot we can change by passing parameters to the .plot() method (see below). However, we think the easiest way to change the legend labels in Python is to rename the columns. Python will automatically use the column names as legend labels just like it did in the first plot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOnce we rename columns to non-machine-readable names that include spaces and special characters, they will be harder to work with in Python.

Watch out for typos in the column name.\nMake a new entry inside the dictionary (look for the curly braces ({})), and change the values to match the other column you want to rename. Make sure to separate the two rows with a comma so Python knows you’re starting a new entry.\nCheck that your code works.\n\n\n\n\n# Rename the columns\ntmax_plot_df = tmax_df.rename(\n    columns={\n        'previous_column_name': \"New Column Name\"\n    }\n)\ntmax_plot_df.head()\n\n\n\nSee our solution!\n# Rename the columns\ntmax_plot_df = tmax_df.rename(columns={\n    'TMAX_ohare': \"O'Hare Airport\", \n    'TMAX_northerly': 'Northerly Island'})\ntmax_plot_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Hare Airport\nNortherly Island\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-06-01\n68\n67\n\n\n2024-06-02\n77\n67\n\n\n2024-06-03\n86\n85\n\n\n2024-06-04\n85\n77\n\n\n2024-06-05\n79\n79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a figure\nNow, we’re ready to make a quality figure of the data!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry It\n\n\n\nBelow, you’ll see some code to make a customized figure of your data.
