    "text": "Case Study: Chicago summer 2024 heat wave\n\n\n\nSource: Illinois State Climatologist; Daily June average temperatures and departures from normal in Chicago\n\n\nAccording to the Illinois state climatology office, daily average temperatures between June 13 and June 25 were 5 to 15 degrees above normal in Chicago and statewide. Overnight temperatures in Chicago were forecast to stay into the 70’s with record breaking temperatures being attributed to climate change.\n\n\nIf you teach in or near Chicago, your students probably have some feelings about how hot it was! The Chicago area is known for its at times extreme weather, but cities get hit particularly hard by heat waves due to the urban heat island effect. This article from WGN explains what this means for cities like Chicago.\n\nHeat kills\nClimate change is intensifying summer heat in Chicago, particularly in heat island areas, which disproportionately affects marginalized communities. These neighborhoods, often with less green space and more heat-trapping infrastructure, face higher temperatures and greater health risks (Chicago Tribune). Chicago O’Hare International Airport is a known heat island often reporting temperatures 5-10 degrees warmer than surrounding communities (NBC Chicago).\n\n\nIs it cooler by the lake?\nMany Chicagoans know that one of the best ways to beat the heat is to head to the lake. In this we’ll try to answer whether it’s really cooler by the Lake, and what Chicago could do to cool down the rest of the City.\n![WGN Temperature Forecast – it’s cooler by the lake!]https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/04/NLanimation10and11.gif)\nWe will select two climate stations located within the greater Chicago area: O’Hare International Airport (Station ID: USW00094846), and Northerly Island (Station ID: USC00111550) to explore trends in maximum daily temperatures.\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of O’Hare Airport by Miguel Angel Sanz - Unsplash. https://fly-ord.com/airlines\n\n\n\n\n\nAerial view of Northerly Island.
