We could work with that, but to make things go smoother (and learn how to work with DataFrames) we can join them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs a join?\n\n\n\nThere are a few different ways to combine DataFrames in Python. A join combines two DataFrames by their index (the dates in our case), checking to make sure that every date matches. In our case, we could concatenate instead without checking the dates, because all the dates are the same for our two DataFrames. That would probably be faster! But also, we think it is more error-prone. For example, it might not tell you that something was wrong if you accidentally downloaded data from two different years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry It: Join two `DataFrame`s\n\n\n\nStarting with the sample code below:\n\nReplace left_df with the name of the first DataFrame. In this case, it doesn‚Äôt matter which one you choose to be on the left, but you need to make sure that it matches the left suffix label (lsuffix).\nReplace right_df with the name of the second DataFrame, making sure it matches rsuffix.\nRun the code and check that your join happened correctly.\n\n\n\n\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    left_df\n    .join(\n        right_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()\n\n\n\nSee our solution!\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    ohare_tmax_df\n    .join(\n        northerly_tmax_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTMAX_ohare\nTMAX_northerly\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-06-01\n68\n67\n\n\n2024-06-02\n77\n67\n\n\n2024-06-03\n86\n85\n\n\n2024-06-04\n85\n77\n\n\n2024-06-05\n79\n79"

As STEM educators we aren‚Äôt usually trained to productively channel student‚Äôs emotions and experiences. In this session we will cover three frameworks that we use at the Earth Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab to foster innovative, cross-cultural science teamwork: active listening, ethical space, and the ‚Äúgroan zone‚Äù. Active listening is an important skill for constructing a classroom environment where team members can express potentially traumatic or upsetting experiences that motivate their learning and inquiry goals. Ethical space is a framework for collaborating across cultures while respecting all team-members‚Äô contributions and sovereignty. Finally, the ‚Äúgroan zone‚Äù refers to the fact that learning and innovating is inherently uncomfortable, and teams who can‚Äôt tolerate that discomfort miss out on the juicy and impactful ideas and understanding that lies on the other side. In this workshop, we will present these three frameworks, practice them using role play, and discuss some ways they can be used to facilitate cross-cultural student projects.",

This article from WGN (alix_martichoux_urban_2024?) explains what this means for cities like Chicago.\n\nHeat kills\nClimate change is intensifying summer heat in Chicago, particularly in heat island areas, which disproportionately affects marginalized communities.

Most things about hte plot we can change by passing parameters to the .plot() method (see below). However, we think the easiest way to change the legend labels in Python is to rename the columns.

Watch out for typos in the column name.\nMake a new entry inside the dictionary (look for the curly braces ({})), and change the values to match the other column you want to rename. Make sure to separate the two rows with a comma so Python knows you‚Äôre starting a new entry.\nCheck that your code works.\n\n\n\n\n# Rename the columns\ntmax_plot_df = tmax_df.rename(\n    columns={\n        'previous_column_name': \"New Column Name\"\n    }\n)\ntmax_plot_df.head()\n\n\n\nSee our solution!\n# Rename the columns\ntmax_plot_df = tmax_df.rename(columns={\n    'TMAX_ohare': \"O'Hare Airport\", \n    'TMAX_northerly': 'Northerly Island'})\ntmax_plot_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Hare Airport\nNortherly Island\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-06-01\n68\n67\n\n\n2024-06-02\n77\n67\n\n\n2024-06-03\n86\n85\n\n\n2024-06-04\n85\n77\n\n\n2024-06-05\n79\n79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a figure\nNow, we‚Äôre ready to make a quality figure of the data!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry It\n\n\n\nBelow, you‚Äôll see some code to make a customized figure of your data.

One way to help have a positive conversation about climate change is to talk about solutions. After all, when it comes to a life-or-death issue like heat waves, we can‚Äôt let the conversation end with observing the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversation Starter\n\n\n\nWhat are some short- and long-term strategies for mitigating the effects of heat on your community? If you were implementing mitigation strategies, who would you reach out to first? Below are some examples of some types of strategies you could discuss:\n\nReaching out to vulnerable community members through cultural and religious institutions to provide aid such as transportation to an air conditioned space, ensure water supply, and cool down buildings with strategies like fans and radiation-blocking window films.\nCulturally and climatically appropriate changes to the built environment to reduce heat absorption and storage during heat waves.\nCulturally and climatically appropriate changes and/or expansion of green space to reduce heat absorption and storage\nCultural events to help your community adapt\n\n\n\nMaking cultural connections is important for achieving learning goals and engaging diverse groups of students.\n\n\n\nWe have also developed this activity so that it can be adapted to many different academic disciplines, and we encourage you to do so in your classes! For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscipline\nLearning Goals\n\n\n\n\nPhysics\nExplain how aspects of heat transfer such asalbedo, thermal mass, and latent heat relate to the Urban Heat Island effect\n\n\nBiology\nBiological concepts that cause the Urban Heat Island effect such as transpiration, photosynthesis, and homeostasis\n\n\nStatistics\nProbability distributions for average and extreme temperatures, stationarity, and hypothesis testing to determine differences among sites\n\n\nCalculus\nProcesses governing heat transfer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More: Air Temperature vs. Surface Temperature\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôll be looking at air temperature in this analysis rather than surface temperature. Some of you may have clocked that the surface temperature is more related to the Urban Heat Island mechanism! However, the two are closely related, so we think we can still examing Urban Heat Island effects using air temperature. Check out this resource from the EPA (us_epa_learn_2014?) on the relationship between air temperature and surface temperature and the Urban Heat Island effect:",

In this we‚Äôll try to answer whether it‚Äôs really cooler by the Lake, and what Chicago could do to cool down the rest of the City.\n\n\n\nWGN Temperature Forecast ‚Äì it‚Äôs cooler by the lake!\n\n\nWe will select two climate stations located within the greater Chicago area: O‚ÄôHare International Airport (Station ID: USW00094846), and Northerly Island (Station ID: USC00111550) to explore trends in maximum daily temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of O‚ÄôHare Airport by Miguel Angel Sanz - Unsplash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAerial view of Northerly Island.

We could work with that, but to make things go smoother (and learn how to work with DataFrames) we can join them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs a join?\n\n\n\nThere are a few different ways to combine DataFrames in Python. A join combines two DataFrames by their index (the dates in our case), checking to make sure that every date matches. In our case, we could concatenate instead without checking the dates, because all the dates are the same for our two DataFrames. That would probably be faster! But also, we think it is more error-prone. For example, it might not tell you that something was wrong if you accidentally downloaded data from two different years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry It: Join two `DataFrame`s\n\n\n\nStarting with the sample code below:\n\nReplace left_df with the name of the first DataFrame. In this case, it doesn‚Äôt matter which one you choose to be on the left, but you need to make sure that it matches the left suffix label (lsuffix).\nReplace right_df with the name of the second DataFrame, making sure it matches rsuffix.\nRun the code and check that your join happened correctly.\n\n\n\n\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    left_df\n    .join(\n        right_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()\n\n\n\nSee our solution!\n# Join the data\ntmax_df = (\n    ohare_tmax_df\n    .join(\n        northerly_tmax_df, \n        lsuffix='_ohare', \n        rsuffix='_northerly')\n)\ntmax_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTMAX_ohare\nTMAX_northerly\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-06-01\n68\n67\n\n\n2024-06-02\n77\n67\n\n\n2024-06-03\n86\n85\n\n\n2024-06-04\n85\n77\n\n\n2024-06-05\n79\n79",

Most things about hte plot we can change by passing parameters to the .plot() method (see below). However, we think the easiest way to change the legend labels in Python is to rename the columns. Python will automatically use the column names as legend labels just like it did in the first plot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOnce we rename columns to non-machine-readable names that include spaces and special characters, they will be harder to work with in Python.

Watch out for typos in the column name.\nMake a new entry inside the dictionary (look for the curly braces ({})), and change the values to match the other column you want to rename.
