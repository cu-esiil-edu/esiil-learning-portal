# **Chicago Symposium**
The [Chicago Symposium](https://chicagosymposium.org/) is a forum for faculty and graduate students in education, mathematics, and science devoted to improving teaching and learning of mathematics and science. Our inter-disciplinary forums bring together people from universities, 4-year colleges and 2-year colleges.

#### **Mission Statement**
*The mission of the Chicago Symposium Series is to sustain a dynamic interdisciplinary, inter-institutional community of scholars, who are well-informed about national and local initiatives and research on mathematics and science education, for the purpose of improving instructional practice.*

#### **Goals**
* To encourage productive dialog among faculty from universities, 4-year colleges and community colleges on the common issue of instructional improvement.
* To highlight exemplary practices from Chicago area institutions.
* To assist Chicago area faculty in making and maintaining professional contacts.
* To inform mathematics and science faculty on current research in mathematics and science education and point out ways in which research can directly impact their own teaching.
* To increase awareness of how institutions of higher learning may impact pre-college math and science instruction and involve faculty in preparation of future teachers.
* To strengthen relationships and partnerships with the Chicago Public Schools
