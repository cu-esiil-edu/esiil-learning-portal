# STEP -1: Wrap up

Don't forget to store your variables so you can use them in other notebooks! Replace `var1` and `var2` with the variable you want to save, separated by spaces.

```{python}
%store var1 var2
```

Finally, be sure to `Restart` and `Run all` to make sure your notebook works all the way through!
