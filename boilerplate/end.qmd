## Wrap up

Don't forget to store your variables so you can use them in other notebooks! This code will store all your variables. You might want to specify specific variables, especially if you have large objects in memory that you won't need in the future.

```{python}
%store
```

Finally, be sure to `Restart` and `Run all` to make sure your notebook works all the way through!
