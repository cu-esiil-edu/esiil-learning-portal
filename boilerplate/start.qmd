# STEP 0: Set up

To get started on this notebook, you'll need to restore any variables from previous notebooks to your workspace. To save time and memory, make sure to specify which variables you want to load.

```{python}
%store -r
```

You will also need to import any libraries you are using in this notebook, since they won't carry over from the previous notebook:

```{python}
# Import libraries
```
