    "section": "Adding your own images",
    "text": "Adding your own images\nIncluding images from the web is the easiest way to add images to your site, but you will probably want to include your own images! There are three common ways that you can add images you have taken or created to your website:\n\nUploading an image to your portfolio repository on GitHub\nUploading an image elsewhere and then linking to it\nGenerate an image with code and render it into your website\n\nWe’ll try out the first two options in this lesson. But first, you need to understand the difference between absolute and relative URLs on the web.\n\nAbsolute and relative links\nOn your website, you can link to files on the web, or you can link to local files.\nAbsolute URLs are on the web, and so they begin with something like http:// or https://. When you are using an absolute link, you don’t need to worry about your file structure – for example, what folder your Markdown file is in. If you move things around in your project the link will still work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nLinks on the internet aren’t forever. If you are using an absolute link, you should check on it occasionally to make sure it’s still there. You can also select image sources that are more reliable long term, or even an image with a permanent link or Digital Object Identifier (DOI).\n\n\nRelative links are to files that are local, or in the same location as your website. Keep in mind that what is local can change if you keep multiple copies of your repository, such as one on GitHub and one on your computer. Relative links, because they will change depending on the file and directory structure of your website. If you are working on your own computer, you can link to a file that isn’t in your repository, and then it won’t show up when you deploy your site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a directory?\n\n\n\nDirectory is another word for a folder on your computer – you can organize files by putting them in directories.\n\nThere’s a couple of special characters when using relative links. Suppose you have a Markdown file in a pages directory, and an image you want to display in an img folder:\n&lt;username&gt;.github.io/\n├── README.md\n├── pages/\n│   └── index.md\n└── img/\n    └── cool_satellite_image.jpeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak Code: File Trees\n\n\n\nIn the text diagram to the left, indentation and lines are being used to show which files are inside which folders – for example the index.md file is indented under the pages directory and connected by a line, indicating that index.md is inside pages.\n\nWhen you are working in index.md, you are in the pages directory. If you want to go up a directory to &lt;username&gt;.github.io from pages, you can use ... For example, ../img/cool_satellite_image.jpeg.\nYou can also make website paths starting from the root directory of the site, in this case &lt;username&gt;.github.io, by starting the path with a slash character, /:\n\n\n\nKeyboard highlighting the slash key\n\n\nThe equivalent link to ../img/cool_satellite_image.jpeg would be /img/cool_satellite_image.jpeg.\n\n\nUpload an image to GitHub\n\nSTEP 1: Create an empty image directory on GitHub\nIt’s important to keep your files organized in a project like a website. Before uploading any images, you should make a place to put them. By convention, images in most websites are kept in the img directory, but you can name it whatever you want.\ngit, the system used by GitHub to keep track of changes to files, doesn’t keep a record of directories without any files in them, and as of now you can’t upload an image to a directory that doesn’t exist yet. This puts us in a bit of a pickle! Fortunately, there’s a common solution – we’ll create an empty text file named .keep in the new directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak Code – why .keep?\n\n\n\nYou could name your empty placeholder file anything you want. However, there are two good reasons to use .keep as your filename. First, files that start with a dot (.) are hidden in unix-based operating systems like linux and MacOS, which helps avoid clutter when you are looking at your files. Second, adhering to the convention means that anyone else looking at your repository will know what the .keep file is doing there.\n\nTo create a img/.keep file, go to the main page of your website repository on GitHub and click the Code tab. Then, find the + menu button on the upper right and select Add a file from the dropdown:\n\n\n\nClick add a file\n\n\nType `img/.keep into the name field and then commit your changes:\n\n\n\nName the file img/.keep and commit\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Commit\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Commit again to confirm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen you type img/, GitHub will automatically make a folder, so only .keep will be visible in the text box.\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: Upload your image to the img directory\nFirst, make sure that the name of your image file on your computer is descriptive and machine-readable (doesn’t contain any spaces or special characters other than _, -, or .). You won’t be able to rename your file once you upload it to GitHub.\nYou should now be in the img directory in your repository. If note, you can get there from the Code tab in your website repository, by clicking on the img directory in the files. From there, click the Add file menu in the upper right, but this time select Upload files:\n\n\n\nClick on Add file, then Upload files\n\n\nDrag your image file, or browse and select it.\n\n\n\nCommit file upload\n\n\nFinally, write a message and click Commit changes: \n\n\n\nOther places to host images\nGitHub has a couple of limitations when it comes to hosting images:\n\nThe site will not allow you to upload files larger than 100MB\nIf you make changes to an image file, GitHub will keep all the previous versions, which can make your repository unwieldy to download. If you are generating image files yourself and changing them frequently, consider hosting them somewhere else.\n\nSo, where can you host images that you have taken or generated? There are a few options:\n\nYou can use the Free Image Hosting service to upload images without an account or giving up any information about yourself. Note that while you retain ownership of these images you are granting a license to Free Image Hosting to use them however they want.\nFor a final version, you can use a research hosting service like figshare to upload images and get code to embed them in your website.\nIf you want to use photos you have already uploaded to social media, you can usually get a direct link by right-clicking on the image and selecting Copy Image Link.\nYou will likely find that most file storage services such as Google Drive and Dropbox don’t provide you with a direct link to images that you can use in a website. You can look for instructions on generating direct links for these files, but they are often unsupported and could change without warning.\nThere’s another way of hosting on GitHub that doesn’t have the same drawbacks when it comes to large files. You can include files in a release, which creates a direct link to files, but does not attempt to track changes. To get started, follow the instructions from GitHub documentation. Note that once you have a release you can add additional files to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBy uploading images to social media or other hosting services, you are sometimes giving up your rights to the image, or granting. Photo apps like Flickr are usually better bets, since they are built for photographers with copyright protection in mind. But be sure to read the fine print when uploading material that is sensitive to you personal or to your community – you can look for the term ownership rights in the Terms and Conditions of whatever sites you use.",

    "text": "Use HTML to add features that aren’t available in Markdown\nWhen creating your webpage, you might want to do a couple of things with your content that most types of Markdown can’t do, such as:\n\nSpecify the size of an image\nControl whether links open up in a new tab\nEmbed videos and other web content\nChange colors, fonts, or font sizes in one section of your page\n\nHTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language), does have the ability to do all those things and more.\n\nMake sure to format your HTML code so that it is readable\nOne great thing about Markdown is that it is both human-readable and machine-readable. It’s a little harder to tell what is going on with HTML, especially if it is formatted poorly. For example, take a look at some Markdown and its equivalent in HTML. Unlike Markdown, the computer doesn’t care how we use whitespace when formatting HTML. We can make HTML easier to read by adding whitespace and new lines:\n\nMarkdownMessy HTML (Don’t do this!)Cleaner HTML\n\n\n1# A fabulous Earth Data Science Portfolio\n\n2![Super-cool satellite imagery](/img/cool_satellite_image.jpeg)\n\nSome text and [a link](https://www.my_link.org) and:\n\n  * A\n  * Bulleted\n  * List\n\n1\n\nThe will be a level 1 header because it begins with one #\n\n2\n\nThis will be an image since it starts with a !\n\n\n\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A fabulous Earth Data Science Portfolio&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;img \nsrc=\"/img/cool_satellite_image.jpeg\" alt-text=\"Super-cool satellite imagery\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some text and &lt;a \nhref=\"https://www.my_link.org\"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; \nand:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulleted\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;List&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n1&lt;h1&gt;A fabulous Earth Data Science Portfolio&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n2&lt;!-- Comments help the reader understand your code --&gt;\n&lt;img \n  src=\"/img/cool_satellite_image.jpeg\" \n3  alt=\"Super-cool satellite imagery\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n  Some text and &lt;a href=\"https://www.my_link.org\"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; \n  and:\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Bulleted&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;List&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n1\n\nThis is a level 1 header, since it is surrounded by h1 tags.\n\n2\n\nComments won’t appear on your web page\n\n3\n\nThe img tag will be an image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML syntax for Markdown users\nEvery coding language has some special characters and structures, known as the syntax. When you render or run code, the syntax gets interpreted into some kind of behavior. For example, in Markdown, the syntax # gets interpreted as the start of a level 1 header.\nHTML is less human-readable than Markdown. To use it effectively, you will need to understand some key vocabulary about the syntactic elements of HTML.\n\nTags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak Code\n\n\n\nRemember that the &lt; and &gt; symbols are usually used to surround text you should replace with something applicable to you and your project. There’s a BIG exception when it comes to building websites – &lt; and &gt; are key special characters if you are using HTML, the markup language used on most websites. So, if the code sample is HTML, you should leave the angle brackets &lt; and &gt; in.\n\nNotice that most elements are surrounded by tags enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;). For example, when we include a header 1, we do that with the following code:\n1&lt;h1&gt;\n2  A fabulous Earth Data Science Portfolio\n3&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n1\n\nStart with the opening tag for h1 (header level 1), then\n\n2\n\nPlace the text of the header in between the tags.\n\n3\n\nEnd with the closing tag, which match the opening tag plus a slash (/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf there is no text that needs to go between two HTML tags, you don’t need a closing tag. Instead, you can end the opening tag with /&gt; to indicate that there’s no content. For example, take another look at the image HTML code:\n&lt;img \n  src=\"/img/cool_satellite_image.jpeg\" \n  alt=\"Super-cool satellite imagery\" /&gt;\n\n\n\n\nParameters\nIn addition to marking the beginning and end of HTML elements, tags can contain addition information about how to display their contents. This extra information is known as parameters. For example, let’s revisit the code above for an HTML link, which contains the href parameter:\n1&lt;a href=\"https://www.my_link.org\"&gt;\n  a link\n&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1\n\nParameters are included inside the opening tag. The parameter name (href) must be followed by and equals sign =, and the parameter value (https://www.my_link.org) must be surrounded by quotation marks.\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude HTML directly in Markdown\nYou can add HTML elements into your Markdown documents. There is no need when using GitHub Pages to write entire documents in HTML; you can directly substitute HTML elements for Markdown elements where needed. For example,\n\n\nAdjust the size of images\nSay you have written the following Markdown to display an image:\n![Super-cute pika!](/img/pika.jpg)\n\n\nImage source: Wikipedia\n\nUnfortunately, the image is taking up the entire width of the section. You can’t adjust the size with GitHub Markdown alone, but you can replace the image with HTML and control the width:\n&lt;img \n  src=\"/img/pika.jpg\" \n  alt=\"Super-cute pika!\" \n  width=\"25%\"&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you set both the width and the height of an image, your image will become distorted:\n&lt;img \n  src=\"/img/pika.jpg\" \n  alt=\"Super-cute pika!\" \n  height=\"100px\" \n  width=\"400px\"&gt;\n\n\n\nWhen setting image height and width, there are different units you can use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\npx\nA pixel is the smallest item that can be displayed on your screen\n\n\nem or rem\nThese units are relative to your font size (e.g. the width of an m)\n\n\n%\nA percentage of the element that contains the image\n\n\n\nWhen using px, keep in mind that others may be viewing your webpage on different devices (e.g. phone vs. computer). px units are pegged to the resolution of the screen, so this can result in vastly different sizes on different devices. Furthermore, rem measurements will change if the viewer zooms in or out of the page in their browser, making them more accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can simulate what your webpage will look like on another device using the Web Developer Tools. Usually there’s a button that looks like a screen in the upper right.\n\n\n\nWeb developer tools with the device simulator highlighted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen external links in a new tab\nWhen you are linking to someone else’s webpage, often you want that page to open in a new tab or window so your reader doesn’t leave your webpage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that some web designers and readers don’t like this behavior and would prefer that the reader decide for themselves whether they open a new tab or not. But it’s a pretty widespread practice, so it’s up to you how you want your webpage to work.\n\nThere’s no way to do this in most flavors of Markdown, but if you write your link in HTML you can at a target=\"_blank\" parameter:\n&lt;a \n  href=\"https://www.my_link.org\"\n  target=\"_blank\"&gt;\n  a link\n&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nEmbedding content from other webpages\nMarkdown is great for text and images, but what if you want to content that is hosted elsewhere, like a video? HTML lets you load content from other webpages (also known as embedding content) using an element called an iframe:\n&lt;iframe \n  width=\"467\" height=\"831\" \n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oly8f4h5C78\" \n  title=\"Natural Habitat Shorts- Chipmunks have cheek pouches used to store food. 🐿🥜\" \n  frameborder=\"0\" \n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" \n  allowfullscreen&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n\nUsually the website that hosts your video will already have embed code prepared for you. For example, on YouTube you can find the embed code below the video:\n\n\nStyling text\nStyle on a webpage refers to how the page looks. For example, you might want to change colors, fonts, or spacing on your page. Usually this would be done with CSS or with pre-styled theme elements. However, if you doing something small, you can use the style parameter in an HTML tag, as in the following examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the \n&lt;span style=\"color: red; font-size: 2rem\"&gt; \n  color and font size\n&lt;/span&gt;.\nChange the  color and font size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe are using the span tag here instead of the p (paragraph) tag, so that HTML will not put the text on a new line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a border to an image:\n\n&lt;img \n  src=\"/img/cool_satellite_image.jpeg\" \n  alt=\"Super-cool satellite imagery\" \n  height=\"100rem\"\n  style=\"border: dashed 5px blue;\"&gt;",

Follow these instructions from GitHub.\nEven if you don’t ultimately end up using one of these themes, you can make sure that everything is working with one of these themes.\n\n\nRemote themes\nGitHub Pages allows you to add any Jekyll theme available on GitHub to your site with a configuration file.\nTo do this you can: 1. Choose the Jekyll theme you want to use (here are some examples). Note that some themes work more seamlessly than others, so you may have to try more than one. 2. Preview the theme by clicking Live Demo on jekyllthemes.io, or searching the GitHub README for a preview link. 3. Follow the instructions from GitHub on how to apply the theme using a _config.yml file. 4. Go to the GitHub repository for the theme by clicking on the Get THEME on GitHub button on jekyllthemes.io. Follow any instructions about customizing things like your name or the title of your webpage.\n\n\n\nSo what is YAML?\nThe _config.yml file is written in YAML, a human-readable format for structured information (lists and key/value pairs). Learn more about YAML on their website\nThe _config.yml file that you created to add a theme can also sometimes be used to change the title of your website from the default (the name of your repository). Check out the README for your theme to see what parameters are available For example, and example _config.yml file for the minimal theme looks like:\ntitle: J. Doe's Awesome Portfolio Website\ndescription: Check out my projects!\nlogo: img/headshot.png\nremote_theme: pages-themes/minimal@v0.2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou may need or want to add a _data/data.yml file or your own templates in _layouts in addition to the _config.yml file, depending on your theme. You will need to read the README for the theme you are using to see what you can customize. We recommend copying any example configuration files from the theme repository, and then modifying them to meet your needs.",

    "text": "Best Practices for Open Reproducible Science Projects\n\n1. Use Consistent Computer Readable Naming Conventions\nMachine readable file names allow your directory structure to be quickly manipulated and handled by code.\nFor example, you may want to write a script that processes a set of images and you may want to sort those images by date. If the date of each image is included in the file name at the very beginning of the name, it will become easier to parse with your code. The files below could be difficult to parse because the naming convention is not standard.\n```{bash}\n* file.jpg\n* file-two.jpg\n* filethree.jpg\n```\nHowever this list of files is easier to parse as the date is included with the file name.\n```{bash}\n* 2020-image.jpg\n* 2019-image.jpg\n* 2018-image.jpg\n```\nSometimes simply numbering the files is enough to allow for sorting:\n```{bash}\n* 01-image.jpg\n* 02-image.jpg\n* 03-image.jpg\n```\nIf your files and directories follow identifiable patterns or rules, it will allow you to more easily manipulate them. This in turn will make it easier for you to automate file processing tasks.\nA few other best practices to consider when naming files within a project:\n\nAvoid spaces in file and dir names: spaces in a file name can be difficult when automating workflows.\nUse dashes-to-separate-words (slugs): dashes or underscores can make is easier for you to create expressive file names. Dashes or underscores are also easier to parse when coding.\nConsider whether you may need to sort your files. If you do, you may want to number things.\n\n\n\n2. Be Consistent When Naming Files - Use Lower Case\nIt might be tempting when naming files and directories to use lower and Upper case. However, case will cause coding issues for you down the road particularly if you are switching between operating systems (Mac vs Linux vs Windows).\nCase in point, have a look at the file names below.\n```{bash}\nmy-file.txt\nMy-File.txt\n```\nIf you want to open / read my-file.txt it would be easy to call:\npandas.read.csv(\"my-file.txt\")\nin Python. This call will work on all operating systems. However, this call:\npandas.read.csv(\"My-file.txt\")\nmay work on some machines (possibly Windows) but it’s likely to fail on Linux or MAC. To keep things simple and to avoid case sensitvity issues, use lower case naming conventions for all file and directory names.\n\n\n3. Organize Your Project Directories to Make It Easy to Find Data, Code and Outputs\nRather than saving a bunch of files into a single directory, consider a directory organization approach that fits your project.\nCreate numbered directories that cover the steps of your workflow - for example:\n```{bash}\n/vegetation-health-project\n    /01-code-scripts\n    /02-raw-data\n    /03-processed-data\n    /04-graphics-outputs\n    /05-paper-blog\n```\nThe numbers before each folder allow you to sort the directories in a way that makes it easier to parse. Notice also that each directory has an expressive (uses words that describe what is in the directory) name. Expressive naming will be discussed in the next section.\nUsing individual directories to store data, scripts, output graphics and then the final paper and blog posts being written for the project makes it easier to find components of your project.\nThis is especially useful for your future self who may need to come back to the project in six months to update things. It also makes is easier for a colleague that you are collaborating with to quickly find things.\nThere is no one perfect example as each project may require different directories. The best advice is to pick something that works well for you and your team and stick to it. It’s best to be consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganized Project\nNon Organized Project\n\n\n\n\n/01-scripts     01-clean-data.py      02-run-model.py     03-create-plots.py  /02-data      /raw-data          /landsat-imagery         /fire-boundary/03-output-graphics    study-area-map.png  /04-final-paper     fire-paper.pdf\nfile1-new.pyfile1.py plotting-test.py  data-file.txt  /old-stuff  testoutput1.txt testoutput2.csv\n\n\n\n\nLook at the example directory structures above. Which structure is easier to understand? In which could you more easily find what you need?\n\n\n\n\n4. Use Meaningful (Expressive) File And Directory Names\nExpressive file names are those that are meaningful and thus describe what each directory or file is or contains. Using expressive file names makes it easier to scan a project directory and quickly understand where things are stored and what files do or contain.\nExpressive names also support machine readibility, as discernible patterns in expressive names can be used by a computer to identify and parse files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressive Project\nNon Expressive Project\n\n\n\n\n/01-scripts     01-process-landsat-data.py      02-calculate-ndvi.py     03-create-ndvi-maps.py  /02-data      /raw-data          /landsat-imagery                /june-2016                /july-2016         /cold-springs-fire-boundary/03-output-graphics    ndvi-map-june-2016.png      ndvi-map-july-2016.png /04-final-paper     veg-impacts-cold-springs-fire.pdf\nwork.pyplotting.py plotting-test.py landsat/ data-file.txt old-stuff/  testoutput1.txt testoutput2.csv\n\n\n\n\nLook at the example directory structures above. Which directory structure (the one on the LEFT or the one on the RIGHT) would you prefer to work with?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWindows Users: Note that the default names of your existing directories often begin with upper case letters (e.g. Documents, Downloads). When creating new directories, use lower case to follow the textbook more easily and for best results from future programming tasks.\n\n\n\n\n5. Document Your Project With a README File\nThere are many ways to document a project; however, a readme file at the top level of your project is a standard convention. When you begin to use GitHub, you will notice that almost all well designed github repositories contain readme files. The readme is a text file that describes data / software packages and tools used to process data in your project. The readme should also describe files and associated naming conventions. Finally, the readme can be used to document any abbreviations used, units, etc as needed.\nThere are other files that you may consider as well such as software installation instructions if those are required, citation information and if the project is one that you want others to contribute to, then a CONTRIBUTING file may be in order.\n\n\n6. Don’t Use Proprietary File Formats\nProprietary formats are formats that require a specific tool (and a specific license often) to open. Examples include Excel (.xls) or Word (.doc). These formats may change over time as new versions come out (example: .xls upgraded to .xlsx.\nIn some cases, certain formats are operating system specific (example: most Linux users do not run Microsoft tools).\nWhen choosing file formats for your projects, think about whether you will have a license to access that file format in the future and whether others have access to the license.\nWhen you can, stick to formats that are operating system and tool agnostic such as .csv and .txt. Text files are not proprietary and thus can be opened on any operating system and on any computer with the right open tools. This allows more people to have access to your files including your future self who might not have a license to open these files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUsing standard data formats increases opportunities for re-use and expansion of your research."

    "text": "Best Practices For Open Reproducible Science Projects - A Case Study\nJennifer recently graduated with a degree in environmental science and got a job working with an environmental non-profit. While a student, she worked on some great projects to build flood models using MATLAB, a proprietary software used to design and run models. In collaboration with a professor and other class mates, Jennifer wrote a paper that was accepted for publication in well known hydrology journal, though some minor changes were requested.\nExcited to get the paper revised for publication, Jennifer tracks down her project files and tries to remember which files produced the final outputs that she included in the submitted paper. However, she realizes that even when she is able to identify which files she needs, she no longer has access to the MATLAB, which she needs to access the files. Unfortunately, her license expired when she graduated, and her non-profit does not have licenses for MATLAB.\nJennifer’s story can be a common experience for anyone who has moved to a new job where the resources and licenses differ, or who has spent a long time away from a particular project and need to recreate a workflow.\nHow could using organized and expressively named directories have helped Jennifer with this project? How could avoiding proprietary file formats contribute to the longevity of this project?"

    "text": "Use Scientific Programming to Automate Workflows\nMany people begin to use data in tools such as Microsoft Excel (for spreadsheets / tabular data) or ArcGIS (for spatial data) that have graphical user interfaces (GUIs). GUIs can be easier to learn early on as they have a visual interface that can be less overwhelming as a beginner. However, as the data that you are working with get larger, you will often run into challenges where the GUI based tools can not handle larger volumes of data. Further GUI based tools require individual steps that are often manually implemented (unless you build macros or small automation scripts). This makes your workflow difficult to reproduce. Some tools such as Excel require paid licenses which will limit who can access your data and further, will limit including your workflow in a cloud or other remote environment.\nScientific programming using an open source, free programming language like R or Python, is an effective and efficient way to begin building a workflow that is both reproducible and that can be easily shared.\nIn this textbook, you will learn the Python programming language. Python is a free and open source programming language that anyone can download and use. Further it is becomming one of the more popular and in-demand skills in today’s job market. While you will learn Python in this textbook, many of the principles that you will learn can be applied across many programming languages.\n\n \n\nYou can write and run Python code in interactive development environments such as Jupyter Notebook. This image shows how Python code can be organized and run using cells in Jupyter Notebook and how the output is displayed under the executed cells."

These commands can be entered via a Terminal (also known as a Command Line Interface - CLI), which you will work with in this course.\nUsing a Shell helps you: * Navigate your computer to access and manage files and folders (i.e. directories). * Efficiently work with many files and directories at once. * Run programs that provide more functionality at the command line such as git for version control. * Launch programs from specific directories on your computer such as Jupyter Notebook for interactive programming. * Use repeatable commands for these tasks across many different operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux).\nShell is also important if you need to work on remote machines such as a high performance computing cluster (HPC) or the cloud. Later in this textbook, you will learn how to use a Bash (a specific implementation of Shell) to access and manage files on your computer and to run other programs that can be started or run from the Terminal, such as Jupyter Notebook and git.\n\n \n\nThe terminal and shell (bash) can be used to view file directory structures.

Git provides a way to create and track a “repository” for a project, i.e., a folder where all relevant files are kept. GitHub is a cloud-based platform to host git repositories, which allows you to store and manage your files and track changes. GitHub also includes project management and communication features that are useful when working on collaborative projects such as issues, forks, and milestone tracking.\nThese tools work together to support sharing files and collaboration within workflows. With git, you can work on your files locally and then upload changes to GitHub.com. If you make your repository public, then others can find it on GitHub and contribute to your code (if you want them to) which makes it ideal for collaboration and sharing. GitHub is also useful for code review as others can comment on changes to a workflow and you can chose to accept or reject proposed changes.\nLater in this textbook, you will learn how to use the git/GitHub workflow to implement version control for your files, share work and collaborate with others.\n\n \n\nYou can make local copies on your computer of repositories on Github.com, using git commands that you run in the Terminal.

    "text": "The Jupyter Project\nThe Jupyter project is an open source effort that evolved from the IPython project to support interactive data science and computing. While the project evolved from Python, it supports many different programming languages including R, Python and Julia and was designed to be language-agnostic. The Jupyter platform has been widely adopted by the public and private sector science community. If you are familiar with the R programming language, Jupyter Notebook can be compared to R Markdown.\nThere are three core tools that you should be familiar with associated with Project Jupyter. The text below which describes these tools was copied directly from the  Jupyter Website:\nJupyter Notebook: The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source browser-based application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n\n \n\nA Jupyter Notebook file can contain both text documentation as well as programming code, which can be executed interactively within Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\nJupyterLab: JupyterLab is a browser-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: you can configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab is extensible and modular: you can write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones.\n\n \n\nJupyter Notebook (left) is a browser-based interface that allows you to write code in many programming languages, including Python, and add formatted text that describes what the code does using Markdown. Jupyter Lab (right) provides access to Jupyter Notebook but also allows you to work with multiple documents, including notebook files and other files, at a time.\n\n\nJupyterHub: A multi-person version of Jupyter Notebook and Lab that can be run on a server. This is the tool that supports the cloud based classroom used in all of the Earth Analytics courses and workshops.\nYou will learn more about Jupyter tools in later chapters of this book.\n\nOrganize and Document Workflows Using Jupyter Notebook Files\nConnecting your entire workflow including accessing the data, processing methods and outputs is an important part of open reproducible science.\nJupyter Notebook files can help you connect your workflow by allowing you to write and run code interactively as well as organize your code with documentation and results within individual Jupyter Notebook files. You can also export Jupyter Notebook files to HTML and PDF formats for easy sharing.\nIn this textbook and in our Earth Analytics courses, we use Jupyter Notebook with Python. As described previously, Python is a widely used programming language in the sciences and provides strong functionality for working with a variety of data types and formats.\nWriting and organizing your Python code within Jupyter Notebook files supports open reproducible science through documentation of data inputs, code for analysis and visualization, and results – all within one file that can be easily shared with others.\nIn later chapters, you will learn how to use Jupyter Notebook to write and run Python code for analysis and visualization of earth and environmental science data."

    "text": "What is Open Reproducible Science\nOpen science involves making scientific methods, data, and outcomes available to everyone. It can be broken down into several parts (Gezelter 2009) including:\n\nTransparency in data collection, processing and analysis methods, and derivation of outcomes.\nPublicly available data and associated processing methods.\nTransparent communication of results.\n\nOpen science is also often supported by collaboration.\nReproducible science is when anyone (including others and your future self) can understand and replicate the steps of an analysis, applied to the same or even new data.\nTogether, open reproducible science results from open science workflows that allow you to easily share work and collaborate with others as well as openly publish your data and workflows to contribute to greater science knowledge.\n\n \n\nAn open science workflow highlighting the roles of data, code, and workflows.

    "text": "How Do You Make Your Work More Open and Reproducible?\nThe list below are things that you can begin to do to make your work more open and reproducible. It can be overwhelming to think about doing everything at once. However, each item is something that you could work towards.\n\nUse Scientific Programming to Process Data\nScientific programming allows you to automate tasks, which facilitates your workflows to be quickly run and replicated. In contrast, graphical user interface (GUI) based workflows require interactive manual steps for processing, which become more difficult and time consuming to reproduce. If you use an open source programming language like Python or R, then anyone has access to your methods. However, if you use a tool that requires a license, then people without the resources to purchase that tool are excluded from fully reproducing your workflow.\n\n\nUse Expressive Names for Files and Directories to Organize Your Work\nExpressive file and directory names allow you to quickly find what you need and also support reproducibility by facilitating others’ understanding of your files and workflows (e.g. names can tell others what the file or directory contains and its purpose). Be sure to organize related files into directories (i.e. folders) that can help you easily categorize and find what you need (e.g. raw-data, scripts, results).\n\n\nUse FAIR Data to Enhance the Reproducibility of Projects\nMake sure that the data used in your project adhere to the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016), so that they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable, and there is documentation on how to access them and what they contain. FAIR principles also extend beyond the raw data to apply to the tools and workflows that are used to process and create new data. FAIR principles enhance the reproducibility of projects by supporting the reuse and expansion of your data and workflows, which contributes to greater discovery within the scientific community.\n\n\nProtect Your Raw Data\nDon’t modify (or overwrite) the raw data. Keep data outputs separate from inputs, so that you can easily re-run your workflow as needed. This is easily done if you organize your data into directories that separate the raw data from your results, etc.\n\n\nUse Version Control and Share Your Code (If You Can)\nVersion control allows you to manage and track changes to your files (and even undo them!). If you can openly share your code, implement version control and then publish your code and workflows on the cloud. There are many free tools to do this including Git and GitHub.\n\n\nDocument Your Workflows\nDocumentation can mean many different things. It can be as basic as including (carefully crafted and to the point) comments throughout your code to explain the specific steps of your workflow. Documentation can also mean using tools such as Jupyter Notebooks or RMarkdown files to include a text narrative in Markdown format that is interspersed with code to provide high level explanation of a workflow.\nDocumentation can also include docstrings, which provide standardized documentation of Python functions, or even README files that describe the bigger picture of your workflow, directory structure, data, processing, and outputs.\n\n\nDesign Workflows That Can Be Easily Recreated\nYou can design workflows that can be easily recreated and reproduced by others by: * listing all packages and dependencies required to run a workflow at the top of the code file (e.g. Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown files). * organizing your code into sections, or code blocks, of related code and include comments to explain the code. * creating reusuable environments for Python workflows using tools like docker containers, conda environments, and interactive notebooks with binder."

    "text": "Open Reproducible Science - A Case Study\nChaya is a scientist at Generic University, studying the role of invasive grasses on fires in grassland areas. She is building models of fire spread as they relate to vegetation cover. This model uses data collected from satellites that detect wildfires and also plant cover maps. After documenting that an invasive plant drastically alters fire spread rates, she is eager to share her findings with the world. Chaya uses scientific programming rather than a graphical user interface tool such as Excel to process her data and run the model to ensure that the process is automated. Chaya writes a manuscript on her findings. When she is ready to submit her article to a journal, she first posts a preprint of the article on a preprint server, stores relevant data in a data repository and releases her code on GitHub. This way, the research community can provide feedback on her work, the reviewers and others can reproduce her analysis, and she has established precedent for her findings.\nIn the first review of her paper, which is returned 3 months later, many changes are suggested which impact her final figures. Updating figures could be a tedious process. However, in this case, Chaya has developed these figures using the Python programming language. Thus, updating figures is easily done by modifying the processing methods used to create them. Further because she stored her data and code in a public repository on GitHub, it is easy and quick for Chaya three months later to find the original data and code that she used and to update the workflow as needed to produce the revised versions of her figures. Throughout the review process, the code (and perhaps data) are updated, and new versions of the code are tracked. Upon acceptance of the manuscript, the preprint can be updated, along with the code and data to ensure that the most recent version of the paper and analysis are openly available for anyone to use."

    "text": "The internet has revolutionized science publishing. For example, most published scientific papers are now made freely available online within one year (Randall Munroe 2013):\n\n\n\nThe Rise of Open Science: The accelerating pace of scientific publishing and the rise of open access, as depicted by xkcd.com cartoonist Randall Munroe. Open access reached a tipping point in 2011, when more than half of new research became available freely online.\n\n\nIt’s not just peer-reviewed publications that have changed – scientists all over the world now use websites, blogs, and social media to discuss, communicate, and publicize their work. The internet is also a great way to transparently involve your community in your research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNot all science has to be open! It’s important to think about the impacts of publishing your work on people and communities wherever you are studying, and also honor principles data sovereignty. We will talk about some ways to publish your work while omitting or obscuring sensitive details, but for now make sure that you and your mentors are comfortable before putting your work on the internet.\n\n\nThere are lots of tools available for creating free websites. We, as Earth and Environmental Data Scientists, like to use a platform called GitHub Pages for a couple of reasons:\n\nIt’s completely free to use, event for larger websites (like this one!).\nIt is a feature of the code collaboration website GitHub, which is already where most programmers and scientists keep their code. Keeping our websites on GitHub also means that we can collaborate on and discuss them online, the same way we would any other code.\nIt can automatically build an attractive website using text-based, human-readable tools.\nIt can automatically incorporate the plots and maps generated by code.\nThough GitHub itself is not open source software (it’s owned by Microsoft), Pages is built on open-source tools. This means that if for some reason the availability or pricing structure ever changes we could download the code and put the website up somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out our explainer video to learn more about what a personal portfolio webpage can do for you, and see some examples from previous students!\n\n \n\nINTRO: Portfolio pages by ESIIL\n\n\n\nIn the following lessons, you will learn how to create a personal portfolio webpage and publish it for free using GitHub Pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate your own portfolio webpage\n\n\nDocument and share your work\n\n\nShow potential employers and collaborators what you can do, and share your work! In this activity, you will create a personal portfolio webpage. You’ll use this webpage to share some biographical information and a photo of yourself. You can then update your webpage with links to work that you complete. \n\n\n\n\n\nNate Quarderer, Elsa Culler\n\n\n7 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd images to your portfolio\n\n\nAs they say, a picture’s worth 1000 words\n\n\nEffective scientific communication is often built on visual evidence, so it’s important to be able to include photographs, figures, and maps into your webpages. \n\n\n\n\n\nNate Quarderer, Elsa Culler\n\n\n8 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize your website content\n\n\nGet started with HTML\n\n\nMarkdown is nice because it is easy to read, and lets us get started building websites quickly. But, it can’t do everything! Adding Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) will let you include multi-media materials and customize how your page looks and behaves. \n\n\n\n\n\nNate Quarderer, Elsa Culler\n\n\n9 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpruce up your website\n\n\nGet started with Jekyll themes\n\n\nIt can be challenging to build an attractive website from scratch. Fortunately, many web designers have created themes to make any website look great. \n\n\n\n\n\nElsa Culler, Nate Quarderer\n\n\n4 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a map to your website\n\n\nGet started with maps\n\n\nAs Earth and Environmental Data Scientists, we know places are important. In this activity, you will make your first map in Python, and use it to tell the story of where you come from and what places are important to you. \n\n\n\n\n\nNate Quarderer, Elsa Culler\n\n\n5 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nRandall Munroe. 2013. “The Rise of Open Access.” Science 342 (6154): 58–59. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.342.6154.58.",
